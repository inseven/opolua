title: Reporting Issues
---

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/inseven/opolua/issues) are the best way for us to track and triage problems and feature requests. Please check for any existing issues before raising a new one--if you don't find one, we'd love to hear your thoughts.

We're happy to receive issues with as much or as little information as you are able to give (something is better than nothing) but, where possible, please try to provide:

- details of the program you were running
- as much information as possible about what you were doing when you encountered the issue
- specific instructions that might help us reproduce the issue
- help on how to find the program you were running to let us test changes
